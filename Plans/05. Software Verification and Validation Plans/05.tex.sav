    \section{Introduction}
        \subsection{Purpose}
            \paragraph{} This Software Verification and Validation Plans (SVVP) specifies the tasks to be performed for Kreogist Mail software project (The project). This SVVP is written in accordance with IEEE Std 1012-1998.
        \subsection{Scope}
            \paragraph{} The scope of this SVVP is to verify and validate all Kreogist Mail software (Mail) and to validate all packaged and embedded software components for conformance to requirements for safety factors, response time, expandability, and external interfaces. Until a customer is under contract, the acceptance testing activities will not be included.
        \subsection{Objectives}
            \paragraph{} The objectives of this SVVP are to verify and validate all developed software and interfaces for conformance with Mail requirements for response time, expandability, and safety factors.
        \subsection{Applicability}
            \paragraph{} This SVVP applies to the products of the requirements, design, implementation, and test phases of Mail development cycle.
        \subsection{Waivers}
            \paragraph{} This SVVP deviates from IEEE Std 1012-1993 in that it will not be applied to the following phases:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Concept phase
                \item Installation and checkout phase
                \item Operation and maintenance phase
            \end{itemize}
            This SVVP has been developed during the concept phase and applies to subsequent phases. The V\&V planning for the installation and checkout phase, and the operation and maintenance phase will be deferred until a customer installation has been identified for the project.

        \subsection{Resources summary}
            \paragraph{} The project resource summary please check the reference section in SPMP$^{[\ref{ref:spmp}]}$. All the resource for V\&V team is list below:
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item Team leader
                    \item Project manager
                    \item Quality Assurance Manager
                \end{enumerate}
            \paragraph{} V\&V team will be setup after all the project is done and Software Quality Assurance team ensures that the software is ready to be released. Software Quality Assurance team should hand in a report that the latest version is ready to be checked by V\&V team.
        \subsection{Responsibilities}
            \paragraph{} Main responsibility for V\&V team tasks, as described in section \ref{section:tasks}, i.e. \emph{Master schedule}, lies with team leader. Team leader can delegate the tasks within V\&V team. All the problems have to be reported to team leader, and all the problems will be gathered and report to Kreogist Dev Team. In case team leader will be unavailable for a short period of time, one of the team member will assume his tasks. If team leader will be unavailable for a longer period of time, V\&V team must be expanded and the tasks reorganized. Project Manager will be responsible for this.
        \subsection{Tools, techniques, and methods}
            \paragraph{} All the tools and development environment could be found at section \emph{Methods, Tools, and Techniques} of SPMP$^{[\ref{ref:spmp}]}$.

                \item Software Quality Assurance team report.
            \end{enumerate}
            \paragraph{} The following items should be prepared:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Target platform machine.
                \item System interfaces on target platform.
            \end{enumerate}
            \paragraph{} The following tools should be prepared for the V\&V process:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item cppcheck
                \item Valgrind
                \item System Process Manager
            \end{enumerate}
            \paragraph{} The process will be divided into the following steps:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Stability verification.
                \item Function verification.
                \item Quality verification.
            \end{itemize}
            \paragraph{} The following section will show up the whole verification check process.
        \subsection{Stability Verification}
            \paragraph{} Code stability test will be done on the following platform:
            \paragraph{Software Requirement}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item OS: Ubuntu Linux 15.10 64-bit
                \item Tools: cppcheck (static analysis tool), Valgrind (dynamic analysis tool)
            \end{itemize}
            \paragraph{Minimal Hardware Requirement}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item CPU: 2.0GHz Intel{\textregistered} Core$^{\texttt{TM}}$ 2 Duo CPU
                \item Memory: 1GB DDR II 800
                \item Disk Space: 1GB of available storage
            \end{itemize}
            \paragraph{} Besides, Qt platform and all the other dependencies of Mail and testing tools will be installed.
            \paragraph{} First, use \texttt{cppcheck} to do the static check of the code. There shouldn't be any critical errors in the following list:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Local auto-variable usage error.
                \item Array out of bound error.
                \item Class error.
                \item Abandon function usage error.
                \item Abnormal memory usage error.
                \item Memory leak.
                \item Abnormal STL function usage error.
                \item Other critical error in the cppcheck critical error list.
            \end{enumerate}
            \paragraph{} Next, compiled the source code and do the dynamic check of the code in Qt Creator with Valgrind. Valgrind shouldn't detect any of the following critical memory errors:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Accesses memory it shouldn't (areas not yet allocated, areas that have been freed, areas past the end of heap blocks, inaccessible areas of the stack).
                \item Uses uninitialised values in dangerous ways.
                \item Leaks memory.
                \item Does bad frees of heap blocks (double frees, mismatched frees).
                \item Passes overlapping source and destination memory blocks to memcpy() and related functions.
            \end{enumerate}
            \paragraph{} The report of cppcheck and Valgrind will be including into V\&V report.
        \subsection{Function verification}
            \paragraph{} Black-box testing will be performed on the implemented software interfaces to ensure that the outputs of each interface are consistent with what is input, based on the interface design.
            \paragraph{} All the requirements define in SRS will be used as input in black box test. All the requirement should be pass the black-box testing with all the known exceptions processed. All the test will be recorded in the report.
        \subsection{Quality verification}
            \paragraph{} Tools included in \texttt{Valgrind} will be used as quality verification. The usage of tools could be founded on the official site of Valgrind: \url{http://valgrind.org/}. All the output of the tools will be recorded as a part of the report.
        \subsection{Summary}
            \paragraph{} In any of the process, if there's one critical error detected, the process will be forced stop, and the V\&V meeting will be marked as failed. The problem will be marked as an issue and it should be setup in Github issue tracking system. The report will be abandon.
            \paragraph{} After all the processes done, the report will be marked as accept. V\&V team will notify Kreogist Dev Team to release Mail.
    \section{V\&V reporting requirements}
        \paragraph{} Summarize all V\&V activities and results, including status and disposition of anomalies in the V\&V final report.
