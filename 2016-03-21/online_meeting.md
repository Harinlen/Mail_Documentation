![images](images/QQ20160321234734.png)

Saki 22:12:42

Something like this.

Saki 22:12:59

Maybe we could add our account system at the end of this project.

Saki 22:13:12

We could store the account information at local first.

Freddie 22:13:22

right

Saki 22:13:41

GJ

Mayazure 22:14:18

sure. What about highlight in inbox panel

Saki 22:14:31

Still on the way.

Saki 22:14:55

I didn't complete that yet.

Mayazure 22:16:31

![images](images/QQ20160321234946.jpg)

Mayazure 22:16:46

win10 style

Saki 22:17:06

I think....

Saki 22:17:17

Well, in the dark style....

Saki 22:17:26

They all look the same...0 0

Saki 22:17:54

![images](images/QQ20160321235023.jpg)

Mayazure 22:18:17

what do you mean

Saki 22:19:18

The only way to highlight one staff in the list of a dark theme, is to use a light grey to be the highlight band.

Saki 22:19:31

Change the color of text to FFF.

Mayazure 22:21:00

I mean the vertical line on the left

Mayazure 22:22:22

there is already light grey color in the list,  do you want to use a lighter color

Freddie 22:22:46

yes

Freddie 22:23:05

maybe a little bit lighter

Saki 22:24:30

Are you sure you want that line...?

Saki 22:24:34

![images](images/QQ20160321235857.png)

Saki(858934854) 22:24:45

Here's an example of the highlight on the title bar.

Saki(858934854) 22:25:16

I'm still thinking about the high light version.

Saki(858934854) 22:25:24

I mean the list items.

Mayazure 22:25:41

it should be good if all the list item has the same grey background 

Mayazure 22:26:16

but I am not sure if they are dark grey and light grey

Saki(858934854) 22:26:38

You mean highlight?

Mayazure 22:27:46

Yes

Saki(858934854) 22:28:22

I will try.

Mayazure 22:30:51

Mayazure 22:31:18

so that I can also have a try

Saki(858934854) 22:31:26

Okay, I will upload it.

Saki(858934854) 22:33:11

I will push it on GIthub.

Mayazure 22:33:25

Saki(858934854) 22:35:44

Already upload on Github.

Saki(858934854) 22:35:54

In today's folder. There's a PSD.

Saki(858934854) 22:36:53

Notice...

Saki(858934854) 22:37:01

Don't upload the changed PSD.

Saki(858934854) 22:37:18

If we change PSD in both side, it won't merge success.

Saki(858934854) 22:37:32

If you do save as, that will be good.

Saki(858934854) 22:41:18
