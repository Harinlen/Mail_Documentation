nearly finished

Saki 19:15:40

The aim of the first poster is to show that your team understands your project and that you can communicate that understanding in a concise and effective manner.



The poster should summarise:



    Project context - client or market, current situation, need for new system

    Concept for new system - architecture, functions, processes

    Expected impact of new system
