Exams are comming, so this iteration will be slower than the normal iteration. We are doing more code review and lower the speed of developing the stuffs.

The following things are the result from the iteration:

1. Fixed the code cannot be compiled bug caused by forgetting adding a line of include. This bug is caused by the compiler, it won't compile the whole project so this part will still passed on some of the development machine. This bug could be find by compiling on another machine.
2. Complete some missing comments in the class headers.
