Doing the major design stuffs.

We define the basic style of the software and chat with client frantic1048 and fzyz999.

We decide to use the same design style of our previous project.

Start to draw the rendering PSD in Photoshop. Prepare for the next week.

Write some basic codes of the infrastructure. It uses exactly the same plugin structure of the Kreogist Mu. The four major manager classes are using the same codes but tweak for the current project.
