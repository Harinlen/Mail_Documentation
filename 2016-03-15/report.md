# Meeting minutes from Kreogist Dev Team meeting 13.3.2016
15, March, 2016

## We made a plan about what we need to do before the next tutor meeting.
We will design the user interface of the email client, draw a draft of the logo.
We will also finish some of basic models in our project and move some functions from our previous project(Music Player Mu) to this project.

## We basicly talked about UI designs in our project. 
In this part, we analyzed the user interface of some popular email clients, including Mail in Windows 10, Outlook 2016, Mail in OS X El Captain and OS X Mavericks and other web-based email client. Compare the strengths and weakeness of them and conclude the complexity of user operating. After a little bit scrach and disscuss, we had a general scheme of what our email client look like due to the practicability of Qt.

## We decided our next meeting time.
We will have next group meeting on 18, March, 2016.
